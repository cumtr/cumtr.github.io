Understanding how populations evolve through time and space, adapt to new or varying environments, and diversify into distinct species is fascinating. My work focuses on the genomic bases and consequences of these evolutionary processes by retracing the history of species, identifying genomic regions involved in organismal adaptation to their environments, and linking genomic variations with phenotypic traits. I have a particular interest in genomic structural variations and their role in evolution.

During my PhD, I studied the genomic basis of the domestication of sheep and goats. Specifically, I examined the impact of the domestication process and subsequent adaptation to different environments on the genome of small ruminants, with a focus on genomic structural variations.

As a post-doc at the University of Lausanne, I investigated the history and evolution of the European barn owl (*Tyto alba*). By integrating genomic and ecological data, I focused on uncovering the historical trajectories of various populations and subspecies within the Western Palearctic, identifying the evolutionary forces shaping them, and exploring how these forces have impacted the genome of this nocturnal raptor.

In my current position at ETH Zurich, I am characterizing the neutral and adaptive history of two cattle lineages, *Bos taurus taurus* and *Bos taurus indicus*. With the help of pan-genome approaches, I aim to integrate all types of genetic variations to refine our knowledge of the domestication of this species.
